# HTML5 & JAVASCRIPT based Video Player

A html5 based video player which uses plain javascript to get json array of video urls

Api calls using "fetch" in javascript.

The javascript code reads the video file name and url from the webservices and load them to the player.

In the current example, the video list is from the json file bundled in the application which can be replaced with any api urls.
